    <h1>Looking for an EvenUp Alternative? Here&rsquo;s What to Consider</h1>

<article>
    <p>EvenUp deserves credit. They effectively created the AI-powered medical record summarization and demand package category for personal injury law firms. Their platform has processed hundreds of thousands of cases, and their brand recognition in the PI legal tech space is unmatched. Many firms that adopted EvenUp early have seen genuine improvements in case throughput and settlement outcomes.</p>

    <p>But a growing number of those same firms are looking for alternatives. The reasons are consistent, and they are worth examining honestly&mdash;both for firms currently using EvenUp and for those evaluating the category for the first time.</p>

    <h2>The Common Complaints</h2>

    <div class="complaint-card">
        <h3>Complaint #1: Price Escalation</h3>
        <p>EvenUp's pricing has shifted significantly since their early growth phase. Firms that signed on at $300 per case have seen costs climb toward $500 to $800 or more, particularly for complex cases involving multiple providers, surgical interventions, or catastrophic injuries. Some firms report that "complex case" pricing has become the norm rather than the exception.</p>
        <p>The per-case model means costs scale linearly with volume. A firm processing 50 cases per month at $500 each spends $300,000 annually. At 100 cases per month, that becomes $600,000. For many firms, this has become one of their single largest operating expenses outside of payroll.</p>
        <p>Additionally, EvenUp has introduced tiered service levels, with premium features and faster turnaround times available at higher price points. Features that were previously included in the base price have, in some cases, migrated to premium tiers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complaint-card">
        <h3>Complaint #2: Cloud-Only Data Handling</h3>
        <p>EvenUp processes all medical records on their cloud infrastructure. This means every case file&mdash;containing protected health information including diagnoses, treatment histories, mental health records, and substance abuse information&mdash;is uploaded to and processed on servers that the law firm does not control.</p>
        <p>EvenUp does sign Business Associate Agreements and maintains SOC 2 compliance. But for firms handling particularly sensitive cases, or for attorneys in states where bar ethics opinions impose heightened duties around cloud storage of client data, the inability to process records locally is a fundamental limitation that no amount of contractual protection can fully address.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complaint-card">
        <h3>Complaint #3: Limited Customization</h3>
        <p>EvenUp's strength is standardization. Their demand packages follow a consistent structure that works well for typical soft-tissue and moderate-injury cases. However, firms with specific preferences regarding demand letter tone, structure, damage presentation, or strategic emphasis often find the customization options insufficient.</p>
        <p>Some firms report that EvenUp's output feels "templated"&mdash;that experienced adjusters and defense attorneys can identify an EvenUp-generated demand on sight. Whether this affects settlement outcomes is debatable, but many attorneys prefer their work product to reflect their firm's distinctive voice and strategic approach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complaint-card">
        <h3>Complaint #4: Turnaround Time Variability</h3>
        <p>EvenUp's human review layer adds quality assurance but also introduces variability. While simple cases may be returned within 24 hours, complex cases can take 48 to 72 hours or more. For firms accustomed to the instant results that pure-AI platforms can deliver, this wait can be frustrating, particularly when a case needs to be resolved quickly or when an attorney wants to iterate on the demand approach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="complaint-card">
        <h3>Complaint #5: Feature Gaps</h3>
        <p>Despite being the market leader, EvenUp's feature set has remained relatively focused on medical chronologies and demand packages. Features that some firms need&mdash;such as negligence detection against standard-of-care protocols, injury visualization for demand exhibits, or automated case task management&mdash;are not part of the EvenUp platform.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What to Look for in an Alternative</h2>

    <p>If you are evaluating alternatives to EvenUp, these are the criteria that matter most, based on conversations with firms that have made the switch:</p>

    <h3>Cost Predictability</h3>
    <p>The number one frustration with EvenUp is the unpredictability and escalation of per-case costs. Any alternative worth considering should offer a pricing model that does not punish you for processing more cases. Flat monthly subscriptions are one approach. A perpetual license with no per-case fees is the most cost-effective model at scale.</p>

    <h3>Data Sovereignty</h3>
    <p>Ask where your data goes. Specifically: does the platform upload PHI to cloud servers? Which cloud provider? Does data pass through third-party AI APIs? Is data retained after processing? Can you get a clear, written answer to all of these questions? If the vendor cannot answer definitively, that is informative in itself.</p>

    <h3>Output Quality</h3>
    <p>Request sample outputs on a case file you are already familiar with. Compare the chronology accuracy, narrative quality, and damages presentation against what you are currently getting from EvenUp. Quality should be at least comparable before cost savings become relevant.</p>

    <h3>Feature Breadth</h3>
    <p>Medical chronologies and demand packages are the baseline. Evaluate what else the platform offers. Negligence detection, case valuation, injury visualization, and workflow automation features can add significant value beyond basic summarization.</p>

    <h3>Switching Costs</h3>
    <p>How much effort will it take to move your workflow? Does the alternative integrate with your case management system? Can your staff be trained in a reasonable timeframe? A technically superior product that takes months to adopt may not be worth the transition.</p>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>The Honest Trade-Offs</h2>

    <p>No comparison is complete without acknowledging what you give up when moving away from EvenUp:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Human review before delivery.</strong> EvenUp's model includes a human review step that catches AI errors before you see the output. With MedRecords AI's hybrid approach, your team performs that review. This means slightly more work on your end, but also more control over the final product.</li>
        <li><strong>Established integrations.</strong> EvenUp has had years to build integrations with major case management platforms. MedRecords AI, as a newer entrant, has a smaller integration ecosystem, though it supports standard file formats and common CMS connections.</li>
        <li><strong>Market credibility.</strong> EvenUp's name carries weight. When you tell opposing counsel or an adjuster that your demand was prepared using EvenUp, they know the platform. That brand recognition has intangible value, though the trend toward AI-assisted practice is normalizing all platforms in the eyes of the market.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Should Consider Switching</h2>

    <p>An EvenUp alternative makes the most sense for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>High-volume firms</strong> where per-case fees have become a top-three operating expense</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-conscious practices</strong> that want PHI to stay on their own hardware</li>
        <li><strong>Firms wanting more features</strong>, particularly negligence detection and injury visualization</li>
        <li><strong>Firms frustrated with turnaround time</strong> and wanting instant AI-generated first drafts</li>
        <li><strong>Firms seeking cost predictability</strong> who want to eliminate variable per-case billing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you are a smaller firm happy with EvenUp's quality, comfortable with its pricing, and unconcerned about cloud data handling, staying put may be the pragmatic choice. Not every firm needs to switch. But if any of the complaints above resonate with your experience, the alternatives have matured to the point where switching is a realistic and often financially advantageous decision.</p>
